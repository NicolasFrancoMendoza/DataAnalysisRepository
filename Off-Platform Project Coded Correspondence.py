complete_message = """Hey there! How have you been? I've been great! I just learned about this really cool type of cipher called a Caesar Cipher. Here's how it works: You take your message, something like "hello" and then you shift all of the letters by a certain offset. 

For example, if I chose an offset of 3 and a message of "hello", I would encode my message by shifting each letter 3 places to the left with respect to the alphabet. So "h" becomes "e", "e" becomes "b", "l" becomes "i", and "o" becomes "l". Then I have my encoded message, "ebiil"! Now I can send you my message and the offset and you can decode it by shifting each letter 3 places to the right. The best thing is that Julius Caesar himself used this cipher, that's why it's called the Caesar Cipher! Isn't that so cool! Okay, now I'm going to send you a longer encoded message that you have to decode yourself!

complete_message = """Hello again friend! I knew you would love the Caesar Cipher, it's a cool, simple way to encrypt messages. Did you know that back in Caesar's time, it was considered a very secure way of communication and it took a lot of effort to crack if you were unaware of the value of the shift? That's all changed with computers! Now we can brute force these kinds of ciphers very quickly, as I'm sure you can imagine.
            
To test your cryptography skills, this next coded message is going to be harder than the last couple to crack. It's still going to be coded with a Caesar Cipher but this time I'm not going to tell you the value of the shift. You'll have to brute force it yourself.
            
Here's the coded message:
